# The Python-Calculator
The Python-Calculator is just a simple calculator that can only do addition and subtraction.
It's best to read the information when first running the program. This program runs terminal only.
If you make any edits to the code please share them with me @BlackHack10110 on Twitter.
I'd love to see it.
